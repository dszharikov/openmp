# Parallel-Programming-Examples

This repository contains examples and solutions related to parallel programming using OpenMP in C++. The examples cover various parallelization techniques and demonstrate their impact on performance.

## Contents:

1. **Atomic Operations:**
   - Demonstrates the use of atomic operations in OpenMP for parallel reduction.

2. **Locking Mechanisms:**
   - Introduces locking mechanisms (using locks) for synchronization in parallel programming.

3. **Reduction Directive:**
   - Utilizes the reduction directive in OpenMP for parallel reduction.

4. **Scalar Product Calculation:**
   - Calculates the scalar product of vectors sequentially and in parallel using OpenMP.

5. **File I/O and Scalar Product:**
   - Illustrates reading vectors from a file and parallel scalar product calculation using OpenMP.

6. **Nested Parallelism:**
   - Investigates nested parallelism and evaluates its impact on program execution time.

7. **Matrix Operations:**
   - Explores parallelization of matrix operations using OpenMP, including the effect of nested parallelism.

8. **Loop Scheduling:**
   - Compares different loop scheduling strategies (static, dynamic, guided) in OpenMP.
